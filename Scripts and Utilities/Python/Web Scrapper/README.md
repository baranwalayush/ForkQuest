# Web Scrapper — README
## Overview
The script scrapes job listings from a sample job board and saves them in a JSON file.

## Task
The file `main.py` contains syntax and logic bugs.  
**fix the script** so it fetches job listings from [Real Python Fake Jobs](https://realpython.github.io/fake-jobs/) and saves them as JSON.

When fixed, running `python3 main.py` should:
1. Create a file named `YYYY-MM-DD-hhmmss_jobs.json`
